Assignment #1
Description: Intro to image manipulation in Matlab

File included: 
	- one.m (matlab script file)
	- cheshire_normal.JPG (image taken under normal room light)
	- cheshire_flash.JPG (image taken with camera flash light)
	- my_pixinfotool.m (Matlab helper function for showing intensity values)

To run: On command prompt, please type:
$ matlab -r one
==============

Explanation:

Given two images of size 4000x3000, this matlab program will:

1. read the images (one taken in normal room light and 
the other taken with camera flash ON).  

2. resize the images to 10x smaller (i.e. 400x300)

3. save the images in grayscale format as files named
"grayscale_cheshire_normal.JPG" and "grayscale_cheshire_flash.JPG", 
respectively.

4. select portion of the images/matrices that contains only the
cheshire cat, and displays one of them in 400x400 scale.
(Note: the program could have displayed the second image, but it's 
not very interesting, so we commented that part out from the code)

5. save the magnified image patches in step 4 as 
'magnified_grayscale_cheshire_normal.jpg' and 
'magnified_grayscale_cheshire_flash.jpg', respectively

6. invoke an external function from Matlab documentation to
see the pixel values interactively for BOTH images, and take the 
screenshots of the intensity values in particular sections of 
these two images.  We named them as 'intensity_values_normal.jpg' 
and 'intensity_values_flash.jpg' in the homework folder.


(Observation)
7. From the above two images obtained in step 6, we look at the 
intensity values approximately around the same area (i.e. cheshire
cat's chin+neck+arm area).  We notice that the intensity values seem
to be higher on average for the image taken with flash ON vs. under 
normal room light. This makes sense because the intensity values are
higher for the brighter objects and the flash version of the image 
surely received more intense light when taken.

Notes for Phyo (myself):
rgb2gray converts RGB values to grayscale values by forming a weighted sum of the R, G, and B components:
0.2989 * R + 0.5870 * G + 0.1140 * B 

In a true color image of class double, the data values are floating-point numbers in the range [0, 1]. In a true color image of class uint8, the data values are integers in the range [0, 255], and for true color images of class uint16 the data values are integers in the range [0, 65535].
