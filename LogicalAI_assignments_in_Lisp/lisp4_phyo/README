Submission for Lisp4 project
Due 5:00M, Friday 12/07/12
Phyo Thiha

Files included
===============
- phyo_src.lisp -->	Implementation of code to detect inconsistency in the knowledge base
- helper.lisp -->	Contains for helper functions for unit testing and other purposes
- phyo_test.lisp -->	Contains test cases for the assignment (needs "helper.lisp")
- src/ --> 		Folder containing source and compiled files of ttt

To run the unit tests, please load the file in ACL as below
: (load "phyo_test")
and check the output that are deduced from the facts and rules entered 
in the test file. 

Notes/Description
=================
(Note to Adam: if the STDOUT is too noisy, please set verbose to nil.)

I have implemented an extension of Lisp 3 assignment. 
Now, the knowledge base (KB) can detect contradictory facts/rules.
If the added knowledge is inconsistent with those that already are entered, 
the KB will add the negation of it. This is accomplished by creating four 
hash tables--two each for new and old rules/facts--and using them as 
cross-references in checking the newly added knowledge (rule/fact).
I also made sure the STDOUT's from the tests are readble/understandable 
to the TA.

I tried to write the code as modularly as possible. I also named the functions 
so that the names let the reader/grader know the intended purpose of those functions.
Please read the comments that I made for each function in the "phyo_src.lisp" file for 
explanation of their functionalities. Thank you.
