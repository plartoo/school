Submission for Lisp1 project
Due 4:59PM, Monday 10/1/12
Phyo Thiha


- phyo_src.lisp --> Implementation of match-expr function specified in the assignment
- test-helper.lisp -- Lisp unit testing framework from Peter Seibel's Practical Common Lisp.
- phyo_test.lisp --> Contains test cases for functions in phyo_src.lisp (needs test-helper.lisp)


To run the tests, please load the file:
   (load "phyo_test")

And invoke a whole suite of tests by typing:
   (test-all)

to test all the functions.

Note:
I tried to write the code as modularly as possible, coupled with unit tests
for each helper-fuctions. I also named the functions such that their names let
the reader/grader know the intended purpose of those functions. Please read
the comments that I made along the way in the "phyo_src.lisp" file for 
big-picture explanation of their functionalities. Thank you.
