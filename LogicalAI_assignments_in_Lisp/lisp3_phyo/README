Submission for Lisp3 project

Phyo Thiha

Files included
===============
- phyo_src.lisp -->	Implementation of functions specified in the assignment
- helper.lisp -->	Helper module for unit testing and other helper functions
- phyo_test.lisp -->	Contains test cases for the assignment (needs "helper.lisp")
- src/ --> 		Folder containing source and compiled files of ttt

To run the unit tests, please load the file in ACL as below
: (load "phyo_test")
and check the output that are deduced from the facts and rules entered 
in the test file. 

Notes
=====
Since I set the verbosity level to be ON, it prints out contents
of the hash table, which cloggs up the terminal output (STDOUT).
The deduced facts will be shown with the preceding "=> " in the output.

I suggest the grader (Adam) to comment out different/irrelevant tests in 
"phyo_test.lisp" to see the FULL relevant output for individual test 
he wants to focus on grading. That way, the grader can compare the output
he sees in STDOUT with the expected outputs that I've written out 
in "phyo_test.lisp". If there is problem running the unit tests, please 
recompile the ttt source files in folder named, "src".

I tried to write the code as modularly as possible. I also named the functions 
so that the names let the reader/grader know the intended purpose of those functions.
Please read the comments that I made along the way in the "phyo_src.lisp" file for 
explanation of their functionalities. Thank you.
