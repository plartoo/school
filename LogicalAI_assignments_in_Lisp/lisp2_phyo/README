Submission for Lisp2 project
Due 11:00AM, Tuesday 10/23/12
Phyo Thiha

- phyo_src.lisp --> Implementation functions specified for the assignment
- test-helper.lisp -- Helper module for unit testing
- phyo_test.lisp --> Contains test cases for functions in phyo_src.lisp (needs test-helper.lisp)

To run the tests, please load the file in ACL as below
: (load "phyo_test")

Note:
I tried to write the code as modularly as possible. I also named the functions 
so that the names let the reader/grader know the intended purpose of those functions.
Please read the comments that I made along the way in the "phyo_src.lisp" file for 
big-picture explanation of their functionalities. Thank you.
