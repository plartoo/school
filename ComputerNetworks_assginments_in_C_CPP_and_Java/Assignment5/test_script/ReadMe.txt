File(s):
1. RCWManager.java
==============
To compile:
	javac RCWManager.java

==============
To run
	java RCWManager
==============
Implementation:

Read all files without knowing files' name in the folder where RCWManager.java is.
Currently, it will read all files without extension names in the folder like the file you gave me "a b 1 2".

Thus, if we keep formatting file name in this way, my code should work well.
If something is wrong, please let me know.

Finally, it will output results to "result.txt"
